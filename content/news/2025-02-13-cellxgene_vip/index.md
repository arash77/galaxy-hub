CELLxGENE-VIP (Visualization In Plugin) is an extension of the original [CELLxGENE](https://github.com/chanzuckerberg/cellxgene) tool developed by the Chan Zuckerberg Initiative.
It can efficiently extract deep insights from single-cell RNA sequencing, spatial transcriptomics, and emerging multiome datasets.

This integration enhances the capabilities of high-throughput data exploration and visualization, bridging the gap between computational power and user-friendly analysis.
While CELLxGENE focuses on fast and interactive visualization of single-cell data, CELLxGENE-VIP goes a step further by integrating interactive processing and customized visual analytics, providing deeper insights into the data.

+ It generates a comprehensive set of over eighteen commonly used quality control and analytical plots in high resolution with highly customizable settings.
+ It provides more advanced analytical functions to gain insights into cellular compositions and deep biology, such as marker gene identification, differential gene expression analysis, and gene set enrichment analysis.
+ It pioneers methods to visualize multi-modal data, such as spatial transcriptomics embedding aligned with histological images and the latest 10x Genomic Multiome dataset.
